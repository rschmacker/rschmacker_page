I am a Ph.D. student at Free University Berlin and a research associate at the Public Economics department at DIW Berlin. In fall 2018, I was visiting the Center for Experimental Social Sciences at New York University.

My fields of interest are Public Economics, Behavioral Economics and Experimental Economics.
